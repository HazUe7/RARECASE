NMDA receptor encephalitis has been described following Herpes simplex virus (HSV)\nencephalitis. This case describes a classic presentation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with the\nconcomitant presence of Varicella zoster virus in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nAutoimmune etiologies should be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of encephalitis syndromes. Recent clinical observations\nhave postulated that Herpes simplex virus could potentially trigger\nanti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis. There\nhas only been one case that has linked a varicella zoster virus\ninfection with anti NMDA receptor encephalitis. We present a sec-\nond case with a classical presentation for anti-NMDA receptor\nencephalitis that had varicella zoster virus identified by polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR).\n1. Case report\nA 29 year-old woman, with no significant past medical history,\ncomplained of a 5 day history fever, runny nose, myalgia followed\nby severe headaches and mild changes in mood and behavior. She\nwas brought to the emergency room and underwent a computer-\nized tomography (CT) scan of the head that was normal and was\ndischarged with a diagnosis of “bronchitis”. Three days later she\nwas found confused, with memory impairment and combative.\nShe was brought back to the hospital and a lumbar puncture was\nperformed which revealed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood\ncount (WBC) of 310 cells/mL (94% lymphocytes), glucose 60 mg/dL,\nand protein 0.55 g/L. Acyclovir 10 mg/kg of body weight was started\nevery 8 h for possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. A\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed cortical\n∗ Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: Rodrigo.Hasbun@uth.tmc.edu (R.\nthickening\nHasbun).\nwith increased signal intensity in the mesial temporal\nlobes bilaterally, suggestive of herpes limbic encephalitis. Another\nlumbar puncture was done 48 h later and it showed an improve-\nment in the CSF pleocytosis (64 cells/mL). The patient was placed\non intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to a\nnew right lower lobe consolidation requiring mechanical ventila-\ntion. While attempting to win her off sedation and intubation, she\nwas noted to have generalized convulsions that were treated with\nintravenous lorazepam and phenytoin.\nThe patient was transferred to our hospital 13 days later for\nhigher level of care. Upon arrival her temperature was 37.2◦C,\nother vital signs were normal, during examination she was found\nnot to be following commands, was unresponsive to painful stim-\nulus, and had myoclonic jerks and muscle rigidity. Routine blood\nanalyses were normal. Intravenous acyclovir was continued and on\nday 3 of hospitalization intravenous steroids were started for sus-\npected autoimmune encephalitis (see Fig. 1). She was started on\nintravenous immunoglobulin 0.4 g/kg body weight/day for 5 days\nwhen the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was confirmed,\n(see Fig. 1) and she continued on antiepileptic treatment, with lev-\netiracetam 1500 mg two time’s daily, lacosamide 50 mg twice daily\nand phenytoin 100 mg three times daily, due to seizure activity. She\ncontinued on acyclovir for 7 days in our hospital. She was on acy-\nclovir for 20 days total. The Herpes simplex virus 1 & 2, Enterovirus,\nand the Varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR (done at ViroMed labora-\ntories) in the CSF that were sent prior to admission to our hospital\nwere negative. An extensive infectious diseases work up was initi-\nated with a third CSF that was done 10 days after her initial lumbar\npuncture at the outside hospital. The CSF showed a WBC of 68\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.08.292\n1386-6532/© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nN. Solís et al. / Journal of Clinical Virology 83 (2016) 26–28 27\nFig. 1. Treatments and studies sent during hospitalization (antiviral and immunotherapy treatment).\nwith 95% lymphocytes, red blood cell (RBC) count of 22, protein\n40 mg/dl, glucose of 51 mg/dl. This CSF also had the following neg-\native tests: bacterial culture, Herpes simplex virus PCR, Epstein-Barr\nvirus (EBV) PCR, VDRL, Enterovirus PCR, West Nile IgM, cryptococ-\ncal antigen, Arboviral panel, VZV PCR done at Focus diagnostics,\nand voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies. The CSF was pos-\nitive for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors antibodies. Besides the\nCSF studies mentioned above, an RPR, blood cultures, HIV (Human\nimmunodeficiency virus) antibodies, HIV RNA PCR, arboviral panel\n(Western Equine Encephalitis, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, St Louis\nEncephalitis, California Encephalitis), a serum cryptococcal antigen\ntest, Histoplasma sp. urine antigen, Influenza A y B nasal antigen,\nLyme Western Blot, Coccidioides sp antibodies, and West Nile IgM\nwere all negative.\nMultiplanar multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nof the brain were obtained before and after the administration\nof 15 cc of Multihance. MRI showed no restricted diffusion, with\na suggestion of a subtle increased T2 signal in the hippocampi,\nthat was most prominently observed in the hippocampal tails.\nThere was no abnormal parenchymnal of meningeal enhance-\nment. Over the next days she started with dysautonomias and\nsympathetic storms, orofacial dyskinesia and hyperkinetic move-\nments. She was placed on bromocriptine, lorazepam, clonidine and\npropanolol. The patient underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy\ntube placement. An electroencephalogram showed poor reactiv-\nity to stimuli, lack of an anterior to posterior gradient, lack of a\nposterior dominant rhythm and excessive beta activity compatible\nwith severe diffuse encephalopathy, without epileptiform activ-\nity. As she was clinically worsening and all her infectious diseases\nwork up was negative, noninfectious etiologies were investigated.\nA pelvic ultrasound was done and was noted a 5 cm dermoid\ncyst on the left ovary that was confirmed with computerized\ntomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis. With these findings, N-methyl-\nd-aspartate receptors encephalitis was suspected. An order was\nplaced to detect N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors antibodies, para-\nneoplastic and voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies in the\nleft over CSF; in addition to that, a gynecologist evaluation was\nrequested. The antibodies titers to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors\nwere identified as 1:1280 in the cerebrospinal fluid one week later.\nA diagnostic laparoscopy with left salpingoopherectomy was per-\nformed revealing a mature teratoma. Therapeutic plasma exchange\nwas initiated (5 exchanges in 10 days). Rituximab was initiated, as\nthere was no improvement noted and resulted in mild improve-\nment on facial dyskinesia and hyperkinetic movements, two doses\nwere given. Given the mild decrease in abnormal movements the\npatient was placed again on high doses of steroids for two weeks,\nthen she was discharged and sent to neurology for follow up. The\nday of discharge, the patient didn’t follow commands, had orodysk-\ninesia and myoclonic jerks, and was not responding to\nstimuli.\npainful\nAfter discharge and as part of a clinical study, the third\nCSF saved during her hospitalization was sent to undergo testing\nwith the Biofire®Film Array Meningitis Encephalitis panel that was\npositive for VZV in the CSF. The Biofire VZV PCR was confirmed with\nthe quantitative PCR assay purchased from Genesig (Primerdesign,\nUK). Based on the qPCR results, 3.7 × 103genome equivalents/uL of\nVZV were detected the sample. MRI and EEG two months after the\nfirst seizure were reported as normal.\n2. Discussion\nThe patient had a classic presentation for anti-NMDA recep-\ntor encephalitis with headaches, changes in mood and behavior\nand seizures in a young female with an ovarian teratoma. Her\nMRI showed temporal lobe involvement prompting empirical ther-\napy for Herpes simplex virus (HSV); however, bilateral temporal\ninvolvement is seen more frequently in autoimmune and other eti-\nologies more than in HSV encephalitis [1]. Some etiologies that\nhave been described to have a propensity for temporal lobes\ninclude paraneoplastic disorders, gliomatis cerebri, and infectious\ncauses like tuberculosis, Varicella zoster virus, Mycoplasma pneu-\nmoniae, enterovirus and Balamuthia mandrillaris [1]. The most\ncommon inflammatory disease affecting the hippocampus is limbic\nencephalitis which occurs in three major forms: a paraneoplas-\ntic subtype which is related to onconeural antibodies in patients\nwith malignant tumors, a non paraneoplastic subtype that is mainly\ncaused by voltage gated potassium channel antibodies and an infec-\ntious subtype cause by herpes viruses [2].\nAnti-NMDAR encephalitis was initially described as a paraneo-\nplastic syndrome affecting young women with ovarian teratoma,\nbut can also be associated with sex cord stromal tumors, small cell\nlung carcinoma and testicular teratomas [3]. NMDA receptors are\nfound throughout the central nervous system, mediating synap-\ntic transmission and plasticity. The main target epitopes are in\nthe NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDAR [4]. The major antigen is\nNR1/NR2B, which is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus\nand forebrain. The NMDAR antibodies reacted with nervous tissue\ncontained in the tumor [5]. In our case the patient had the NMDAR\nantibodies detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, but it can be detected\nalso in serum, or only in CSF.\nThis disorder was reported more frequently in young women,\nbut it also includes men. They often develop sudden behavioral\nand personalities changes [5], after a prodromal syndrome of mild\nhyperthermia, headaches, or a viral like process. We observed this\nin our patient who complained of a flu-like illness and headaches at\nthe beginning of her illness. The clinical course is then followed by\nseizures, decreased level of consciousness, abnormal movements\n(orofacial and limb dyskinesia, dystonia and choreoathetosis), auto-\nnomic instability and sometimes hypoventilation [3]. The presence\n28 N. Solís et al. / Journal of Clinical Virology 83 (2016) 26–28\nof a tumor that expresses the NMDA receptor contributes to break-\ning immune tolerance. Given that most patients presented with\nprodromal symptoms, it is likely that BBB is transiently disrupted\n[6].\nIn about 40% of the cases, the MRI of the brain shows transient\ninflammatory changes in cerebral or cerebellar cortex, subcorti-\ncal regions or hippocampus [3] as seen in our patient. A MRI was\ndone two months after the first seizure and it was reported without\nabnormal changes.\nNMDAR antibodies can be detected in patients with herpes sim-\nplex encephalitis. In a study by Prüss et al., 30% of the patients with\nherpes simplex encephalitis had NMDAR IgM, IgA or IgG antibodies\ndetected in serum or CSF [6]. In our case the patient had the VZV\ndetected with the CSF that was stored at −70C as part of a clinical\nstudy that evaluated the performance of the Biofire® Film Array\nMeningitis Encephalitis panel [7]. During the course of the illness,\nVZV was not detected by two PCRs, one done at ViroMed labora-\ntories and one performed by Focus Diagnostics. The cause for this\ndiscordance is unknown but could be secondary to the Biofire®Film\nArray PCR being more sensitive or that this was a false positive\nresult. As the Biofire VZV PCR was confirmed with the quantita-\ntive PCR assay purchased from Genesig, the former possibility is\nfavored. There are studies that document a low sensitivity of a CSF\nVZV PCR [8]. In this study only 30% of patients had a + VZV PCR\nwhile intrathecal VZV IgG antibody production was documented\nin 93% of patients with VZV vasculopathy. Furthermore, a recent\nstudy evaluating the Biofire® Film Array Meningitis Encephalitis\nPCR demonstrated that the majority of discordant results seen are\nFilm Array positive suggesting a higher sensitivity that with current\nassays [9].\nTo our knowledge, there is only case report that has linked vari-\ncella zoster infection with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [10].\nThese two cases suggests that other neurotrophic viruses such as\nVZV can also serve as triggers for anti-NMDA receptor encephali-\ntis, most likely by causing inflammation and possibly exposing\nNMDAR epitopes [10]. Cell mediated immunity controls VZV, and it\nis thought that the CD4 response is responsible for the prevention\nof VZV reactivation [11]. It is also plausible that VZV reactivated\ndue the severity of illness or due to the immunosuppressive ther-\napies she received as it has been also been seen with other herpes\nviruses such as Epstein Barr virus and cytomegalovirus [12,13]. Our\npatient received steroids that can also affect the proliferation and\ndifferentiation of T cells, and plasma exchange that can be asso-\nciated with a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio. This would be a less\nlikely explanation for her reactivation as her immunophenotyping\nof peripheral blood by flow cytometry showed absent B cells but a\nnormal T cell population.\nVZV remains a rare cause of CNS infections but this is most likely\nthe result of under diagnosis [14,15] or due to a low sensitivity of\nthe current available CSF VZV PCR assays [8]. The role of VZV in\npatients with anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis needs to\nbe further evaluated.\nFunding\nNational Center for Research Resources (NIH-1 K23 RR018929-\n01A2) (PI.

Discussion\nBoth serum and cerebrospinal fluid from this patient contained IgG that bound to CNS\ntissues in a pattern consistent with NMDA receptor specific-IgG (Figure 2A and B;\nimmunofluorescence titer [expressed as the reciprocal of doubling serum dilutions] was\n3840). NMDA receptor specificity was confirmed using NMDA receptor transfected and\nnontransfected cells (Figure 2C and D, Euroimmun slides). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nanalysis revealed a white blood cell count of14 ×106 cells/l with lymphocytic predominance,\nnormal protein and glucose, negative cytology. Routine EEG showed intermittent bursts of\nmixed theta/delta slowing in the left centroparietal region. Brain biopsy showed gliotic brain\ntissue with marked mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes with scattered\nplasma cells. Radiographically, brain MRI in this disorder is usually unremarkable but focal\nenhancement or medial temporal lobe abnormalities have recently been reported [1, 2]. Both\nhypometabolism and hypermetabolism have been reported on FDG-PET [3, 4]. The imaging\nfindings in our patient showed decreased metabolism and enhancement within the limbic\nsystem, as well as extension into the midline cortical structures. The anatomical\nabnormalities were consistent with the patient’s motor and cognitive behavioral issues. The\npatient stabilized after treatment with high dose steroids followed by a five day course of\nintravenous immunoglobulin. He returned five weeks later for increased confusion and a\nseizure. Repeat testing for NMDA receptor antibodies was negative at that time by indirect\nimmunofluorescence (titer <120), although positivity persisted on transfected cells\n(Euroimmun). A decision was made to treat with 5 weekly infusions of rituximab. Over the\nensuing two months, the patient made a dramatic recovery and returned back to his baseline.\nAffected individuals with NRA develop characteristic clinical features, including seizures\nand unresponsiveness, psychiatric symptoms with memory loss, dyskinesias, autonomic\ninstability and hypoventilation. This autoimmune neurological disorder effects a\ndisproportionate number of female children and adolescents and is most commonly\nassociated with ovarian teratoma [5, 6]. In the current report, the effected individual had a\nsimilar clinical course but was male, an adult, and did not have an identified underlying\nmalignancy by pan body CT imaging.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health HD054347 and NS063997-01 to VLS.
